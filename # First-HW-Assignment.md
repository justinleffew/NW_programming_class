**Overview and Origin**

Ethereum was conceptualized in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and The Ethereum Foundation, which included the following individuals:
* Vitalik Buterin
* Mihai Alisie
* Amir Chetrit
* Gavin Wood
* Charles Hosk
* Anthony Di Iorio
* Joseph Lubin
* Jeffrey Wilcke

The Ethereum Foundation was created in Switzerland. They were initially funded via Venture Capital, then by a public crowdsale in 2014, and again via an Initial Coin Offering. In total, there have been 9 funding rounds with $18.4 million in total funds raised. As the Ethereum Foundation holds somewhere around 400,000 Ether, they are able to sell tokens to generate funds when necessary. 

The idea for Ethereum came about after Vitalik Buterin was introduced to Bitcoin. While inthralled with BTC, he began to imagine a platform that went beyond simply financial use cases. A platform that was more of a Swiss Army knife would have many more use cases such as smart contracts, decentralized applications, non-fungible tokens, and more.  


**Business Activities**

Ethereum is trying to solve the middleman problem, of which many downstream problems are derived. 

* Historically, people have needed a trusted centralized third-party to transact and communicate electronically. By allowing any developer to create smart contracts, users are able to exchange value without the need of any one centralized institution.
* In today's world, censorship is getting out of control. Governments, established institutions, and citizens are all actively trying to silence dissenting voices. Ethereum is censorship-free
* The unfair advantages Ethereum has are the number of active developers, currently at over 4,000 per month, as well as the sheer number of dApps build on the ecosystem. 
Ethereum uses the programming language Solidity, which is based on other languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript. 


**Landscape**
* Ethereum is in the "Defi" domain of finance in that its primary function is to allow decentralized applications to run on the system with no third party intermediaries. 
* Other major companies/platforms in this space are Bitcoin, Solana, Binance, Ripple, Cardano, and many more. 

According to Ethereum's website, once a code is deployed to Ethereum, that code cannot be taken down and anyone can use the dApp's features. 

* Decentralized applications (dApps)
* Smart contracts
* Other tokens creation (ERC-20 tokens)

**Results**
* Ethereum has gone from an idea to a platform with a market cap of $350 billion at the time of this writing. 
* There are over 71 million wallets holding Ethereum, though many people have multiple wallets so this is not indicitve of how many individual users there are. 
* While some other platforms are growing more rapidly than Ethereum, ETH is second most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and as is the case with many technology companies and platforms, the network effect means as more people use Ethereum, even more people will use Ethereum which will make it tough for a competitor to overtake it. 

**Recommendations**

If I were to advise the Ethereum Foundation, I would suggest a wallet that is user-friendly to the masses. The learning curve behind using and sending crypto is not easy, and this is leaving an entire older cohort of the population to rely on centralized services like Coinbase to custody their ETH. This would help to increase adoption as well as market capitalization as demand would increase while supply stays the same. 

Frankly, I don't know enough about the technology to make technological recomemndations so I will leave that part alone.
