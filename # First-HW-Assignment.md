Ethereum was conceptualized in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and The Ethereum Foundation, which included the following individuals:
* Vitalik Buterin
* Mihai Alisie
* Amir Chetrit
* Gavin Wood
* Charles Hoskinson
* Anthony Di Iorio
* Joseph Lubin
* Jeffrey Wilcke

The Ethereum Foundation was created in Switzerland. They were initially funded via Venture Capital, then by a public crowdsale in 2014, and again via an Initial Coin Offering. In total, there have been 9 funding rounds with $18.4 million in total funds raised. As the Ethereum Foundation holds somewhere around 400,000 Ether, they are able to sell tokens to generate funds when necessary. 

The idea for Ethereum came about after Vitalik Buterin was introduced to Bitcoin. While inthralled with BTC, he began to imagine a platform that went beyond simply financial use cases. A platform that was more of a Swiss Army knife would have many more use cases such as smart contracts, decentralized applications, non-fungible tokens, and more.  


*Business Activities*

Ethereum is trying to solve the middleman problem, of which many downstream problems are derived. 

* Historically, people have needed a trusted centralized third-party to transact and communicate electronically. By allowing any developer to create smart contracts, users are able to exchange value without the need of any one centralized institution.
* In today's world, censorship is getting out of control. Governments, established institutions, and citizens are all actively trying to silence dissenting voices. Ethereum is censorship-free




According to Ethereum's website, once a code is deployed to Ethereum, that code cannot be taken down and anyone can use the dApp's features. 

* Decentralized applications (dApps)
* Smart contracts
* Other tokens creation (ERC-20 tokens)
